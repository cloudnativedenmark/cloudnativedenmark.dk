## 🏛️ Architecture

### Component Structure

```
src/components/
├── ui/           # Basic UI components (Button, Section, Container)
├── content/      # Content-specific components (SponsorGrid, TeamGrid)
├── layout/       # Layout components (Header, Footer, HeroSection)
└── features/     # Feature components (SessionCard, SpeakerModal)
```

### Data Sources

- **Static Content**: YAML files in `public/data/` (sponsors, hotels) and embedded data (team)
- **Conference Data**: Sessionize API integration for speakers and schedule
- **Data Loading**: Custom utilities in `src/utils/data-loader.ts` for YAML parsing

### Key Features

- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- ⚡ **Performance**: Vite's fast HMR, code splitting, and optimized bundling
- 🎯 **SEO**: Meta tags, structured data, and sitemap generation
- 🔍 **Search**: Fuzzy search for sessions and speakers using Fuse.js
- 📅 **Event Management**: Dynamic conference schedule and speaker profiles
- 💼 **Sponsor Management**: Tiered sponsor system with dynamic logos

## 📊 Data Management

### Sessionize Integration

The site integrates with Sessionize API to fetch:

- Speaker profiles and information
- Conference sessions and schedule
- Event grid and room assignments

Configuration is managed in `src/hooks/use-sessionize.tsx`.

### Content Management

- **Team Data**: Embedded in `src/utils/data-loader.ts` site metadata
- **Sponsors**: YAML files in `public/data/sponsors/`
- **Hotels**: YAML files in `public/data/hotels/`
- **Images**: Organized by category in `public/images/`

## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode with comprehensive type safety
- **React**: Functional components with hooks, no class components
- **Components**: Modular, composition-based design with clear prop interfaces
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 utility classes with variant-based component design
- **Testing**: Unit tests for components and hooks using Jest and React Testing Library

### Component Architecture

- **Modular Design**: Components organized by purpose (ui/, content/, layout/, features/)
- **Variant System**: Components adapt via props (Button variants, Section variants)
- **Barrel Exports**: Clean imports via index.ts files
- **TypeScript Interfaces**: All props and data structures are fully typed
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML

### Performance & Best Practices

- **Image Optimization**: Use native `<img>` tags with proper loading attributes
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic with Vite's build process and React Router
- **Bundle Optimization**: Tree shaking and dead code elimination via Vite
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- **SEO Optimization**: Meta tags and structured data via react-helmet-async
